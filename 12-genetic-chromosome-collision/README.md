# Using Genetic Algorithm to model Chromosome Collision

## Team Members:
- Mohammad Ali Al-Ashkar (94122681004)

## Descreption:
Routing and Chromosome generation using Genetic Algorithm. This project simulates the prediction work for maps

## Algorithms Used:
The algorithms used here are to design the principle the chromosome from the principle to the destination by generating random genes and examining the path.

## Input and Output:
The input is randomly assigned by the application and the output is displayed as a set of fees.
